The objectively best Twitter video downloader bot.

[If you want to self-host this, I suggest doing these things.](https://twitter.com/TheEssem/status/1179800410120474625)

## Usage
Requires Node.js, FFmpeg, and frei0r-plugins:

```shell
sudo apt install nodejs ffmpeg frei0r-plugins
```

Once they're installed, install the required modules using npm:
```shell
npm install
```

Finally, put your consumer key/secret and access token/secret obtained from the [Twitter apps page](https://developer.twitter.com/apps) inside `config.json` and run `node app.js`.

## Disclaimer
This is a parody of video downloader bots and does not actually send users download links. If you need an actual Twitter video downloader, I highly recommend [youtube-dl](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/).
